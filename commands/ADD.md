# git add

When changes have been made inside the repository that you want to keep, you'll need to use the git add command

Items that have not been tracked before will start to be tracked and all other changes will be marked as modified

You can get away with the command `git add . ` which will add ALL files

You can track changes to specific files using `git add file1 file2` which will specifically track those two files
- [git add] (./commands/Add.md)
You can specify tracking directories with `git add DirectoryName`
